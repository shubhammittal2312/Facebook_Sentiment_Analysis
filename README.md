# Facebook_Sentiment_Analysis
imagine that a growing cosmetics company is looking for social media analytics insights to be provided by your group. They asked you to prepare a report analyzing the Facebook page activity of their major competitor.  In order to facilitate your analysis, a representative dataset was collected from the public page of an Australian cosmetics company "Australis Cosmetics" over the time period between 2012 and 2017. The dataset contains information about each post on that page including the type and text content of that post, the content of user comments (if any), the total counts of likes, shares, and comments, as well as the counts of specific emotion-reactions available on Facebook.
